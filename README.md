This is my personal reference of the current state of the accessible web, with suggestion how to improve my markup. You can't rely on my results, because they are seriously lacking in enough results of different screen readers and browsers.

All my advised markup is based on myself, a sighted person, and documentation. So, you should decide for your self if the markup is right for you and your project.

## How to create better accessible websites?

* Learn about real users, e.g. with podcasts:
    * [http://maccessibility.net/feed-podcast.rss]()
* Read or listen to developers who have experience building with accessible sites
    * [https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/web-accessibility-in-2017]()
    * [https://rethink.fm/podcast/episode-7-why-web-accessibility-matters/]()
* Make sure your website is possible to navigate with a keyboard
* Use rich snippets
* Use enough contrast
* Keep your site layout consistent
* Guide the focus of the user to the correct goal
* Give textual context to visual elements

## Accessible sites are expensive!

Learning something is always a slow and expensive process, when you never have taken time to learn it, it will be expensive. When you get used to write accessible code, you will notice that it will barely add extra time!
